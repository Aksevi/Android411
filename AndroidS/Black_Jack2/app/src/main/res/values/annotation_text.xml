    <string name="anotation_text">Dear player, it’s important to remember: the Ace is unique. In Blackjack, it’s a flexible card that can be valued as either 1 or 11, whichever is best for your hand. As long as the total value of your hand with the Ace is 21 or under, it’s counted as 11.
But if that total goes over 21, the Ace automatically becomes a 1 to keep you from busting.</string>  <!-- аннотация перед игрой пока не использовал-->
